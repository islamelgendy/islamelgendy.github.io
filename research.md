## Research Interests  

My research focuses on **Software Engineering**, particularly **Software Testing and Verification**. My key areas of interest include:  

- **Diversity-Based Testing Techniques** 
- **Search-Based Software Testing**  
- **Mutation Testing**  
- **Automated Test Data Generation**  
- **Test Case Prioritization and Selection**  
- **Test Suite Reduction**   

I am currently working on projects that apply diversity-based principles to improve **software testing efficiency and effectiveness**.  

## Ongoing Research  

I am actively investigating:  

- **Targeting Stubborn Mutants:** Exploring test selection strategies for detecting hard-to-kill mutants in mutation testing.  
- **Diversity in Test Case Prioritization:** Applying **bytecode diversity** to optimize test execution order.  

If you are interested in **collaborations** or have inquiries, feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
