## Papers

Welcome to my research papers page. Here, you will find a collection of my published and ongoing research work in **Software Testing**, particularly focusing on **diversity-based testing principles**.

## **Working Papers**

I am currently working on the following research:

- **Targeting Stubborn Mutants: A Study of Test Selection Strategies Killing Stubborn Mutants**

More details will be shared as the research progresses.
